    "Multiprocessing in Python allows you to create multiple processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space. This is particularly useful for CPU-bound tasks, as it can take advantage of multiple CPU cores to perform tasks in parallel, thereby improving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of how multiprocessing works in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import the `multiprocessing` module**: This module provides the necessary functions and classes to create and manage processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a `Process` object**: You can create a new process by instantiating the `Process` class and passing the target function and its arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Start the process**: Use the `start()` method to start the execution of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Wait for the process to complete**: Use the `join()` method to wait for the process to finish its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Share data between processes**: You can use `Queue`, `Pipe`, or shared memory objects like `Value` and `Array` to share data between processes.\n"

    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import the module**: `import multiprocessing`\n",
    "2. **Define the worker function**: This function will be executed by each process.\n",
    "3. **Create and start processes**: In the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, we create and start multiple processes.\n",
    "4. **Join processes**: We wait for all processes to complete using the `join()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**: Python's GIL can be a bottleneck for multi-threading, but multiprocessing bypasses this by using separate memory space for each process.\n",
    "- **Overhead**: Creating processes has more overhead compared to threads, so it's best used for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "- **Data Sharing**: Use `Queue`, `Pipe`, `Value`, or `Array` for sharing data between processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a basic introduction to multiprocessing in Python. There are more advanced features and techniques, such as using `Pool` for managing a pool of worker processes, which can further simplify parallel execution."
