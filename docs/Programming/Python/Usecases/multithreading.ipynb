    "Multithreading in Python allows you to run multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently, which can be useful for I/O-bound tasks. Here's a high-level overview of how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thread Creation**: You create a thread by instantiating the `Thread` class from the `threading` module.\n",
    "2. **Thread Execution**: You start the thread using the `start()` method, which invokes the `run()` method of the thread.\n",
    "3. **Thread Synchronization**: You can use locks, semaphores, and other synchronization primitives to manage access to shared resources and avoid race conditions.\n",
    "4. **Thread Termination**: Threads can be joined using the `join()` method, which waits for the thread to complete."

    "- **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**: Python's GIL allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, which can be a limitation for CPU-bound tasks. However, for I/O-bound tasks, multithreading can still be beneficial.\n",
    "- **Thread Safety**: When multiple threads access shared data, you need to ensure thread safety using synchronization mechanisms like locks.\n",
    "- **Alternatives**: For CPU-bound tasks, consider using multiprocessing instead of multithreading to bypass the GIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates creating two threads that run concurrently, printing numbers and letters with a delay. The `join()` method ensures the main program waits for both threads to finish before printing \"Done!\"."
