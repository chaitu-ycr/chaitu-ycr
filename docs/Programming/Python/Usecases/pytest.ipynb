    "`pytest` is a popular testing framework for Python that makes it easy to write simple and scalable test cases. Here's a brief overview and a guide on how to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is `pytest`?\n",
    "\n",
    "`pytest` is a testing framework that allows you to write test cases for your Python code. It is simple to use, yet powerful enough to handle complex testing needs. It supports fixtures, parameterized testing, and has a rich plugin architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing `pytest`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install `pytest` using pip:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pytest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing Tests with `pytest`\n",
    "\n",
    "To write tests with `pytest`, you typically create a new Python file (e.g., `test_example.py`) and define functions that start with `test_`. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_addition():\n",
    "    assert 1 + 1 == 2\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_subtraction():\n",
    "    assert 2 - 1 == 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "To run your tests, navigate to the directory containing your test files and run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest\n",
    "```\n",
    "`pytest` will automatically discover and run all the test functions prefixed with `test_`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Fixtures\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixtures are a way to provide a fixed baseline upon which tests can reliably and repeatedly execute. You can define fixtures using the `@pytest.fixture` decorator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "@pytest.fixture\n",
    "def sample_data():\n",
    "    return [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_sample_data(sample_data):\n",
    "    assert sample_data == [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameterized Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "`pytest` allows you to run a test function multiple times with different arguments using the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"a, b, expected\", [\n",
    "    (1, 2, 3),\n",
    "    (2, 3, 5),\n",
    "    (3, 5, 8),\n",
    "])\n",
    "def test_add(a, b, expected):\n",
    "    assert a + b == expected\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asserting Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `pytest.raises` to assert that a certain exception is raised:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_zero_division():\n",
    "    with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):\n",
    "        1 / 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "`pytest` is a versatile and powerful testing framework that can help you ensure your code works as expected. It supports simple test functions, fixtures, parameterized tests, and much more. By integrating `pytest` into your development workflow, you can catch bugs early and maintain a high level of code quality."
