    "Pillow is a popular Python library used for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. It is an updated fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and provides more features, bug fixes, and support for Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Pillow\n",
    "To install Pillow, you can use pip:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install Pillow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Usage\n",
    "Here are some basic operations you can perform with Pillow:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Opening an Image\n",
    "To open an image, you can use the `Image.open()` method:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open an image file\n",
    "image = Image.open('example.jpg')\n",
    "image.show()  # This will open the image in the default image viewer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resizing an Image\n",
    "You can resize an image using the `resize()` method:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open an image file\n",
    "image = Image.open('example.jpg')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Resize the image\n",
    "new_image = image.resize((800, 600))\n",
    "new_image.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cropping an Image\n",
    "To crop an image, you can use the `crop()` method:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open an image file\n",
    "image = Image.open('example.jpg')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the cropping box (left, upper, right, lower)\n",
    "box = (100, 100, 400, 400)\n",
    "cropped_image = image.crop(box)\n",
    "cropped_image.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saving an Image\n",
    "To save an image, you can use the `save()` method:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open an image file\n",
    "image = Image.open('example.jpg')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save the image in a different format\n",
    "image.save('example.png')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding Text to an Image\n",
    "You can add text to an image using the `ImageDraw` module:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open an image file\n",
    "image = Image.open('example.jpg')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize ImageDraw\n",
    "draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the text and font\n",
    "text = \"Hello, Pillow!\"\n",
    "font = ImageFont.load_default()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add text to image\n",
    "draw.text((10, 10), text, font=font, fill=\"white\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save the edited image\n",
    "image.save('example_with_text.jpg')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "Pillow is a powerful library for image processing in Python. It allows you to perform a wide range of operations such as opening, resizing, cropping, and saving images, as well as adding text and other graphics. For more advanced usage and features, you can refer to the [Pillow documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)."
