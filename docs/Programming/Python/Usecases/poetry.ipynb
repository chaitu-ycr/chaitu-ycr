    "Python Poetry is a dependency management and packaging tool for Python projects. It simplifies the process of managing dependencies, building, and publishing Python packages. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to use Poetry:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Installation\n",
    "First, you need to install Poetry. You can do this using the following command:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -\n",
    "```\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use `pip`:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install poetry\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Creating a New Project\n",
    "To create a new project, navigate to your desired directory and run:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "poetry new my-project\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will create a new directory called `my-project` with a basic structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Adding Dependencies\n",
    "To add dependencies to your project, use the `add` command:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "poetry add requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will add the `requests` library to your project and update the pyproject.toml file with the dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Installing Dependencies\n",
    "To install all dependencies listed in the pyproject.toml file, run:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "poetry install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Running Scripts\n",
    "You can run your Python scripts using Poetry’s `run` command:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "poetry run python script.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Managing Virtual Environments\n",
    "Poetry automatically creates and manages virtual environments for your projects. You can activate the virtual environment with:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "poetry shell\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Building and Publishing\n",
    "To build your project, use:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "poetry build\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will create distribution files in the `dist` directory. To publish your package to PyPI, use:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "poetry publish\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example pyproject.toml\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of what a pyproject.toml file might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "[tool.poetry]\n",
    "name = \"my-project\"\n",
    "version = \"0.1.0\"\n",
    "description = \"A sample Python project\"\n",
    "authors = [\"Your Name <you@example.com>\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "[tool.poetry.dependencies]\n",
    "python = \"^3.8\"\n",
    "requests = \"^2.25.1\"\n",
    "\n",
    "[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]\n",
    "pytest = \"^6.2.2\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "Poetry is a powerful tool that simplifies dependency management and packaging for Python projects. It helps you maintain a clean and consistent environment, making it easier to manage and share your code."
