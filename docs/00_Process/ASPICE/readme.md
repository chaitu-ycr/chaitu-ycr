## üèÅ What is ASPICE?

ASPICE (Automotive SPICE) is a process assessment model for evaluating and improving automotive software and embedded systems development. It aligns with ISO/IEC 330xx standards and is tailored for the automotive industry.

| Aspect               | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Process Evaluation   | Assesses process capability against standards                               |
| Compliance           | Aligns with ISO/IEC 330xx                                                  |
| Automotive Focus     | Tailored process models for automotive needs                                |
| Improvement Guidance | Identifies current state and guides process improvement                     |

The PRM and PAM conform to ISO/IEC 33004:2015; the Measurement Framework aligns with ISO/IEC 33003:2015.

## üèóÔ∏è ASPICE Model Structure

### üóÇÔ∏è Process Reference Model (PRM)

Processes are organized into three categories:

| Category                  | Description                                  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Primary Life Cycle        | Core development and delivery activities     |
| Organizational Life Cycle | Management and organizational practices      |
| Supporting Life Cycle     | Supplementary/support functions              |

Each process has a **purpose statement** and **specific outcomes**.

### üìè Measurement Framework

Defines **capability levels** and **process attributes (PA)** for systematic assessment.

| Level | Name        | Description                                                    |
|-------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | Incomplete  | Not implemented or fails to achieve purpose                    |
| 1     | Performed   | Implemented and achieves intended purpose                      |
| 2     | Managed     | Planned, monitored, adjusted; work products controlled         |
| 3     | Established | Defined approach, reliably achieves outcomes                   |
| 4     | Predictable | Operates predictively, uses quantitative management            |
| 5     | Innovating  | Continuously improved and adapted                              |

**Nine process attributes** are used to evaluate capability.
