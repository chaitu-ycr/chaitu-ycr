# üöÄ Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

> **Definition:**  
> The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a standardized process used by software teams to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain high-quality software efficiently and predictably.

---

## üéØ Purpose

The SDLC provides a structured approach to software development, ensuring that business needs are met, risks are managed, and quality is maintained throughout the project.

---

## üåç Applicability

SDLC is used in all types of software projects‚Äîranging from small apps to large enterprise systems‚Äîacross industries such as finance, healthcare, retail, and technology.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è SDLC Overview

The SDLC is a systematic process for building software that ensures quality, efficiency, and alignment with business goals. It provides a framework for managing both technical and managerial aspects of software projects.

## üìö Detailed Model Explanations

| Model         | Characteristics | Pros | Cons | When to Use |
|---------------|-----------------|------|------|-------------|
| **Waterfall** | Strict linear progression, each phase must be 100% complete before next begins, comprehensive documentation | Easy to understand/manage, clear milestones, good for regulated industries | Inflexible to changes, late testing, poor fit for complex projects | Fixed/well-documented requirements, short duration, similar previous projects |
| **V Model** | Verification and validation for each phase, testing planned parallel to development, strict discipline | Early defect detection, high reliability, clear accountability | No iteration flexibility, high documentation overhead | Mission-critical systems, reliability > speed, aerospace/medical devices |
| **Prototyping** | Rapid prototype development, user feedback-driven iterations, evolutionary approach | Early user validation, reduced requirement risks, good for UI-heavy apps | Potential scope creep, documentation challenges | Unclear requirements, UI development, proof-of-concept projects |
| **RAD** | Time-boxed development (60-90 days), component-based, heavy user involvement | Faster delivery, high customer satisfaction, reusable components | Requires skilled team, not for high complexity | Well-defined scope, skilled resources, web/mobile apps |
| **Incremental** | Divide system into modules, deliver working increments, prioritize high-risk features | Early ROI, risk distribution, flexible planning | Needs strong architecture, integration challenges | Large systems, partial funding, evolving requirements |
| **Spiral** | Risk-driven iterations, combines prototyping + waterfall, 4 quadrants per cycle | Early risk identification, flexible, good for R&D | Complex to manage, expensive for small projects | High-risk projects, research, long-term developments |
| **Agile** | Iterative (2-4 week sprints), customer collaboration, adaptive planning | Rapid delivery, embraces changes, high transparency | Needs disciplined team, hard to predict timelines | Dynamic requirements, customer availability, startup environments |

- **Scrum:** Sprints with daily standups
